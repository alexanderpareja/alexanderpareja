## üë§ About Me

IT support consultant by day, Linux enthusiast by night. I work primarily with Windows systems in professional settings, but I spend my downtime exploring open-source tools, customizing Linux environments, and hacking together personal projects when inspiration hits. Outside of tech, I enjoy reading, gaming, and chasing the occasional side quest into something new.
